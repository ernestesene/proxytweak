		or in ~/.config/${PROGRAM_NAME}/ on Linux
WHERE: ${PROGRAM_NAME} is the name of this program as written in the Makefile variable
 "PROGRAM"


On Mingw (Windows)
Compile with
	$NDEBUG=1 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc make

If openssl library is not installed in mingw toolchain path, you have to include path to where openssl for mingw is installed
	$NDEBUG=1 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc CFLAGS="-I /path/to/openssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L /path/to/openssl/lib" make

Run:
To run the program on wine/windows
copy /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/libwinpthread-1.dll,  selfsign.crt and
selfsign.key to directory of program before running
